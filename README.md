# Machine-Learning-Coursera-Stanford

This is the repository for my implementations on the Machine Learning course of Stanford University/Coursera.

Taught by [Andrew Ng](http://www.andrewng.org/)

### [Syllabus](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome)

## Linear Regression 
* [Linear Regression & Normal Equation](https://github.com/AdalbertoCq/Machine-Learning-Coursera-Stanford/tree/master/Linear%20regression)
* Implemented linear regresion, mean square distance cost function and gradient descent.
* Example linear regression:

![Cost Function](https://github.com/AdalbertoCq/Machine-Learning-Coursera-Stanford/blob/master/Linear%20regression/Cost%20function.png "Cost Function")


## Logistic Regression & Regularization
* [Logistic Regression & Regularization](https://github.com/AdalbertoCq/Machine-Learning-Coursera-Stanford/tree/master/Logistic%20Regression)
* Implemented logistic regression, binary classification cost function and gradient descent.
* Implemented L2 regularization on cost function and gradient descent.

* Example of logistic regression classification:

* Example of L2 regularization: Shows how a low regularization term (0) results in overfitting and a large one (100) in underfiting
